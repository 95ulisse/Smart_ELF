This is a first prototype implemetation of the knowledge base

Current implementation supports:
* register
* addFact
* query
* subscribe

Will soon support:
 *getAndSubscribe

Will later support:
* addRule
* removeRule


This implemetation is in typescript and will export the interface via node.js

## HOW TO

1. install npm: `sudo apt install npm  (or your system equivalent) `
2. install the necessary module: `npm install`
3. run the test: `npm test`
4. run the websocket server: `npm start`

The server accept connection on a websocket at `ws://localhost:5666`



*kb.ts* is exporting the typescript module 

The file *kb.py* gives you a ugly bind to this mechanism that you can use to invoke kb methods via websocket

The websocket server is waiting for messages in a json-rpc-like format 
```
{ "method": MNAME, "params": paramJsonObject }
```
please refer to *kb.py* to a sample of usage
